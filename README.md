📽 Demo Video: Emoji Odyssey in Action

This video shows a full walkthrough of the Emoji Odyssey web app:
	•	💻 User selects emojis using the built-in emoji keyboard
	•	⚙ Story gets generated instantly in a Gen Z slang-filled tone
	•	🤖 Animated robot reacts by jumping or cheering when a story appears
	•	🐛 Includes both working combos and buggy emoji inputs to show what happens when generation fails
	•	🎉 Captures the randomness, humor, and chaotic creativity behind every emoji-based story

The video highlights the real-time feel of the Emoji-fy experience, giving a clear look into how emojis become quirky, AI-generated Gen Z stories.
